### Education

I am currently studying Health Data Science at the University of New South Wale's [Centre for Big Data Research in Health](https://cbdrh.med.unsw.edu.au/) in Sydney, Australia. 

I have a Bachelor of Science from Cornell University where I studied [Operations Research Engineering](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/orie).


### Work

Following university, I began working as a junior data scientist for Verizon Wireless. My work at Verizon focused on customer analytics, primarily in churn predictive modeling.

Since 2016, I have been working as a principal analyst for the UC San Diego Health System.  I have been the primary analyst for the Deparment of Patient Flow and Capacity Management since 2017. My work at UCSD has focused on building out the analytics infrastructure used by upper level management while also engaging in multiple process improvement projects.  

### Career Interests

I am interested in applying data science techniques in the area of population health.  

### Personal

I enjoy all things sports. I'm an avid reader, cook, runner, and outdoor enthusiast.
