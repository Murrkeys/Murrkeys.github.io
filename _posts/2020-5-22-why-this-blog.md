title: Why Make A Website?
categories: General
---

If you've read my *About Me* information, you know that I'm currently both working and studying full time.  So why take the time to create a personal website?  The idea was sparked a few weeks ago when my term break began.  I suddenly had no school work and the lockdown was still 100% in place where I live (Sydney, NSW).  I decided I wanted to work on some side projects to strengthen my education, while also building out a portfolio of work for future career searches.  Thus, the website idea began to take shape. 

A website allows me to have a central place to showcase my work in an engaging format.  Also, but putting my work and ideas out there, I can force myself to follow through with side projects and ensure I reach a final product.  Ideas are great, and I like many others have a ton, but having a final goal in mind (even if just a blog post) gives me that extra push to complete my idea. 

I'm beginning a journey within the exciting space of healthcare and data science. I look forward to sharing content as I move forward with my education and career. And thanks for taking a look!
