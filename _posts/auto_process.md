### Introduction

The old business adage does, "You can't manage what you can't measure".  And when you are managing business processes, the first step to managing and hopefully improving a process is modeling the process.  During my time at UC San Diego Health, I was fortunate enough to receive my Black Belt certificate in Lean Six Sigma and be involved (both supporting and leading) in multiple process improvement projects across the organiziation.  Each of the projects were different in many ways, however almost every project began with a value stream mapping of the process in question.  Whether it was admitting patients for chemotherapy treatment or environmental services cleaning rooms, the process had to be modeled and analyzed before any solutions could be found.  

If you have ever been involved in similar projects, you probably know how difficult and time consuming this step can be.  It usually involves multiple meetings with the stakeholders to identify the process. Once the process is defined, thorough data analysis still has to be completed to quantify the different steps in the process.  And if the data doesn't exist?  Be ready to shadow the staff, sometimes with your iPhone stopwatch running!  After all this is complete, many times the process model still doesn't adequalety represent what is actually happening.  It's not an entirely data-driven process, and the subjective nature of the exercise can lead to mistakes.  

I am of the opinion that for the majority of cases, this entire exercise should be data-driven and can be automated as a result. In this post, I'm going to explain why I think this is possible and highlight some important use cases.
