A list of books I am currently reading or have read. Think of this as a virtual bookshelf, as much for myself as you.  One day, I may get around to adding in some simple notes about each book.

1. **The Grapes of Wrath** *John Steinbeck*
2. **Atonement** *Ian McEwan*
3. **Where the Crawdads Sing** *Delia Owens*
