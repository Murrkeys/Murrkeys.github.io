When the COVID pandemic took off in early March 2020, my department at UC San Diego Health was tasked with modeling out potential scenarios for the capacity impact on our hospital system.  Lacking the epidemiology expertise needed to create a sophisticated infection model, I decided to use the [CHIME](https://penn-chime.phl.io/) tool developed by the Penn Medicine Predictive Health team. The interactive tool models out potential scenarios based on a variety of input parameters specific to your health system and area. 

As you may know, ICU capacity was one of the most significant constraints facing health systems in response to COVID-19.  Therefore, the *Average ICU Length of Stay*, was an extremely important input parameter that we needed to get right in order to provide accurate projections.  This blog post will summarize the steps needed to estimate this parameter, both early on with limited data and a few months later when more COVID patients had been cared for.
