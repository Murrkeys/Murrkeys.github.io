### Introduction

Like many people, I have a running Note on my iPhone that highlights all my big ideas. The type of ideas you come up with while fighting insomnia on a Monday night. Naturally, many of ideas have to do with applying data science in healthcare.  Throughout my Master's coursework in the past year, I've had the opportunity to reflect on the combination of what I'm learning and my background as an analyst in healthcare system operations.  The result is a bunch of cool ideas that I would love to work on in my future career.  In this post, I will introduce a few of these ideas with the aim to more fully elaborate on each one in a future post.
