### Introduction

The healthcare landscape is continuing to transform from volume to value-based care models in order to lower costs and provide higher quality care for individuals and populations.  Population segmentation holds enormous potential to aid organizations as they transition to patient-centered care models.  Population segmentation aims to address the key issue facing health systems today: how to give the right care, to the right person, at the right time.  However, population segmentation remains a relatively novel approach, and there is a tremendous opportunity to expand on current tools and offerings. 


### What is Population Segmentation?

To achieve true patient-centered care, an integrated care model is needed.  Integrated care aims to coordinate a patient's care across all the different settings and providers a patient might access.  For this to work, the patient's specific needs and characteristics needs to be taken into account.  A popular term many use to describe this idea is precision medicine.  Precision medicine aims to tailor care for the individual based on personal information such as demographics, environment, and genomics.  While precision medicine shows promise for a myriad of future health applications, it is still infeasible today to develop care models and interventions for each individual.  Therefore, population segmentation is a technique that can identify groups of patients with largely similar characteritics that can be used for care delivery.  

At it's core, population segmentation is the process of identifying distinct sub-populations with similar characteristics.  The identification and definition of the sub-populations depends on the question at hand, as well as what data is being used.  For example, a segmentation analysis answering "How do we better attract and retain consumers?" will be very different from one answering "What interventions can we introduce for high utilizers?".  In both cases, the process to create segments is the same, but the data needed is very different.  The former will require customized survery data, along with demographic data, to understand patient's attitudes and preferences towards healthcare.  The latter will require clinic, ED, and hospital utilization and treatment data, along with demographic data, to understand patient's historical usage and morbidity patterns.  

In both cases, the resulting segments can be applied in a variety of ways.
