### Introduction

The healthcare landscape is continuing to transform from volume to value-based care models in order to lower costs and provide higher quality care for individuals and populations.  Population segmentation holds enormous potential to aid organizations as they transition to patient-centered care models.  However, population segmentation remains a relatively novel approach, and there is a tremendous opportunity to expand on current tools and offerings. 


### What is Population Segmentation?

At it's core, population segmentation is the process of identifying distinct sub-populations with similar characteristics.  The identification and definition of the sub-populations depends on the question at hand, as well as what data is being used.  For example, a segmentation analysis answering "How do we better attract and retain consumers?" will be very different from one answering "What interventions can we introduce for high utilizers?".  In both cases, the process to create segments is the same, but the data needed is very different.
