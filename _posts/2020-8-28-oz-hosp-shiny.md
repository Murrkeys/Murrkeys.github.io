title: Australia Hospital Dashboards using R Shiny
categories: [R,Code,Healthcare]
---

I have extensive experience in the development of healthcare dashboards. My position at UC San Diego Health began with tedious, manual updates of enormous, complex Excel dashboards.  Luckily, the bulk of my dashboarding is done in Tableau now.  Tableau offers an easy way to create attractive, automated dashboards that decision makers love to use.  While Tableau is amazing at certain things, it still leaves a lot to be desired. Namely, it doesn't offer great functionality to incorporate custom, statistical analysis into user facing dashboards.  Therefore, I was really excited to learn more about R Shiny during my courses this past term.  This blog post will summarize my final term project and give a basic explanation of how R Shiny apps work.  The entire script for this project can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/Murrkeys/australia_hospital_shiny).
