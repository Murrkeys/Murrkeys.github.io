Have you ever recevied an email like this : *Hi this is so and so.  Would you mind re-doing that analysis from two years ago by updating it for the past year?*.  If you're anything like me, this would lead to a frantic scramble in old folders to find an Excel file that you may, or more probable, may not remember exactly where the data came from.  As a healthcare data analyst who performs plenty of ad-hoc analysis, this is a common experience. 

Well, how to solve this issue?  Enter the unsung hero : Data Management Techniques for Reproducible Research!  Lost in the flashiness of statistics and machine learning algorithms, lies the most important part of any research project involving data that no one cares to talk about. The techniques needed to properly manage the data, and allow for the research to be reproducible. Since my data analyst position is not a research role, I was not familiar with this process.  In this blog post, I will explain the high level techniques associated with sound data management.  A process I am incorporating into my work flows, and you should too! 

## Data Management Techniques

A proper data management plan has the following components : 

*

Where,  
* P(A) is the probability of event A.
* P(B) is the probability of event B.
* P(A/B) is the probability of observing event A if B is true.
* P(B/A) is the probability of observing event B if A is true.
